# Leet-Bone-Tools
This is blender add-on to make animating sets of bones on a character easier.  This tool's primary use is to make saved (cached) selections on a per armature basis.  It also contains some tools to add, delete, and reset key-frames for selected bones on the current frame.  This blender add-on only runs in pose mode.  Selections are saved in an auxiliary text file in the same directory as the blend file.  New bone selections are created in the tool's 3d-view panel. To access this toolsetâ€™s pie menu hold control and click in a 3d-view while in pose mode.
