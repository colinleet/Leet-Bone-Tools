# Leet-Bone-Tools
This blender 2.8 add-on is meant to making animating sets of bones on a character faster and easier.
This tool's primary use is to make saved (cached) selections of bones on a per armature basis.
It also contains some tools to add, delete, and reset key-frames for selected bones on the current frame.

This blender add-on only runs in pose mode.

The user can choose to add cached bones to, or replace, their current selection with cached bone selections.
Cached bone selections are saved in an auxiliary text file in the same directory as the blend file.
New cached bone selections are created and edited only in the tool's 3d-view panel, not in the pie menu.

The panel and pie menu will only appear when an armature is selected in pose-mode.
To access this toolsetâ€™s pie menu hold control and click in a 3d-view when an armature is selected in pose-mode.
